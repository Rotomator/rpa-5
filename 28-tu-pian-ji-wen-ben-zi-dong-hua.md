# 图片及文本自动化

* Click Image - action you can use to click on mostly anything (as long as the image you choose is unique): buttons, menus, text, or even somewhere relative to such an element.
* Click Text - it uses OCR to scan the screen of the virtual machine, enables you to extract a specified piece of text and clicks on it (or next to it, depending on your choice).
* Select & Copy - is the easiest output method being used in Citrix automation, but works only for selectable text, like text boxes.
* Scrape Relative - allows you to scrape just a portion of * an image, relative to an anchor.
